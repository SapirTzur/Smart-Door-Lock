  <h2>Product Description</h2>
  <pre>
  Smart Door Lock is a unique system based on face recognition. This system is very easy to operate,
  all you need to do is to create an account for getting access to editing whom will have permission to open the lock by face recognition.
  This system has a spoof faces recognization so even if someone uses a fake face like an image or video of some person in the permission list it is still locked.
  Also, it sends a notification in real-time to the account when someone unrecognized stands by the door lock with a picture of the same person.</pre>
